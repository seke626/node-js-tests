A suite of functions used to practice Node.js

1: Basic API Test:

Description: This test verifies that the /api/users endpoint returns a list of users in JSON format.
Purpose: To ensure that the API endpoint for fetching users is working correctly and returns the expected data format.

2: Unit Test for a Function:

Description: This test validates the functionality of the calculateTotal function by providing it with an array of items and checking if it returns the correct total.
Purpose: To verify that the calculateTotal function calculates the total of the provided items accurately.

3: Mocking External Dependencies:

Description: This test mocks an external API call using Jest's mocking capabilities to simulate a successful request to fetch user data.
Purpose: To ensure that the getUser function interacts correctly with external dependencies (e.g., Axios) and returns the expected user data.

4: Testing Asynchronous Code:

Description: This test checks if the fetchData function successfully fetches data asynchronously from an external data source.
Purpose: To verify that the fetchData function behaves as expected and retrieves data asynchronously without errors.

5: Integration Test for a Controller:

Description: This test evaluates the functionality of the /api/users endpoint by sending a POST request with user data and checking if the user is successfully created.
Purpose: To test the integration between the API endpoint, request handling, and database operations to ensure that a new user can be created successfully.
